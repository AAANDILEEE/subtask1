# subtask1
This is a c++ program that allows users to translate short English messages into Morse code using ASCII characters for dots and dashes

#HOW IT WORKS
Each English letter or number is mapped to a unique Morse code symbol.
A =.-
B = -...
1 = .---
2 = ..---
Space= /
The program converts evry character of a user-input message to its Morse code equivalent using a dictionary in C++
